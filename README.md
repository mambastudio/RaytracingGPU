# RaytracingGPU
Simple OpenCL ray tracer targeting GPU.

Objective of this project is to:
- Make it simple as possible for debugging purpose and experimental applications like;
  - Accelerating structures (bvh), 
  - Material IDs, 
  - Normals, 
  - Texture UVs, etc.
- To be minimal code as possible
- Base project for expanding to complex algorithms such as:
  - Path tracing
  - Bidirectional path tracing
- Make UI quite interactive for ease of use
- Readability of code is a main criteria
  - Well commented code
